## CMPT 419/726: Machine Learning [Spring 2020]

> Machine Learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. Machine learning algorithms play an important role in industrial applications and commercial data analysis. The goal of this course is to present students with both the theoretical justification for and practical application of, machine learning algorithms. Students in the course will gain hands-on experience with major machine learning tools and their applications to real-world data sets. This course will cover techniques in supervised and unsupervised learning, neural networks / deep learning, the graphical model formalism, and algorithms for combining models. This course is intended for graduate students who are interested in machine learning or who conduct research in fields that use machine learning, such as computer vision, natural language processing, data mining, bioinformatics, and robotics. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed, but students are expected to have or obtain, background knowledge in mathematics and statistics.

I did this as a 2nd year arts major was overcompensating after a horrible co-op experience. Right after this course I got a better co-op, which was as a Security Data Scientist at Telus.
