# CMPT310 Artificial Intelligence

> The goal of this course is to provide students with a survey of different aspects of artificial
> intelligence (AI). A variety of approaches with general applicability will be developed. We
> will start with the AI-as-search paradigm, and discuss generic search strategies and heuristicbased improvements. Logic, in particular first-order logic, will be presented as a formalism for
> representing knowledge in AI systems. The use of probability as a mechanism for handling
> uncertainty in AI will be presented, with a focus on Bayesian networks. Finally, we will
> explore the design of AI systems that use learning to improve their performance on a given
> task. In addition to these topics, specific domains such as computer vision, natural language
> processing, and robotics will be addressed.



[large parts of code taken from *here* ](<https://github.com/zbc963/CMPT310-Artificial-Intelligence>), I have little intention of taking CMPT 310: Artificial Intelligence Survey.

PowerPoints from multiple profs, and recorded lectures, are public posted. Might as well self teach and skip this class, as it is not a hard requirement for upper level AI courses.
