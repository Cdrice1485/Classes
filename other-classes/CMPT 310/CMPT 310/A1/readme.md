# Programming Assignment 1




> In this assignment, your Pac-Man agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. You will build general search algorithms and apply them to Pac-Man scenarios.



[large parts of code taken from *here* ](<https://github.com/zbc963/CMPT310-Artificial-Intelligence/tree/master/pacman>), I have little intention of taking CMPT 310: Artificial Intelligence Survey.

 PowerPoints from multiple profs, and recorded lectures, are public posted. might as well self teach and skip this class, as it is not a hard requirement for upper level AI courses.

### DEMO
run:
```bash
python pacman.py -l bigMaze -z .5 -p SearchAgent -a fn=astar,heuristic=manhattanHeuristic

```
