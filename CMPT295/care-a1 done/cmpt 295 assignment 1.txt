	a) 
	for(int n=0;n<16;n++)
    printf("The return value was:  %d.\n", mystery(str,n));
    n from 0..15 is: 
     n= 0:0
	 n= 1:0
	 n= 2:1
	 n= 3:2
	 n= 4:2
	 n= 5:2
	 n= 6:2
	 n= 7:3
	 n= 8:4
	 n= 9:4
	 n= 10:4
	 n= 11:4
	 n= 12:5
	 n= 13:6
	 n= 14:6
	 n= 15:6

	b) we give a string and a whole number, and we receive number 
	c) decrementation variable for a loop
	d) in the code we decrement %rcx and then we "cmpb	$0x6f, (%rcx)". which means we are searching a lower memory address. 

	so in terms of memory address we are going downwards.

	mov $0, %eax    # make eax 0
	mov $0, %ecx	# make ecx 0

loop:   # " a lable is an address"

# compare  %ecx ,%esi, if true end the loop 
	cmpl %ecx ,%esi 
	jle endloop
	addl %edi,%eax #  a+b ( we do this b number of times )
	incl %ecx # increment 
	jmp loop # do all the above, one more time (1 more iteration)

endloop:

	ret     # ret %eax
